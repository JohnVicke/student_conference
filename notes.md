## Ideas

1. Push notifications(web/mobile) to drive app/website conversion rate

- Measure open-rate and click through comparable to notifications deliver. Was app launched after? Notifications turned off? How much time was spent? Number of sales? Number of logins etc etc. What do users wants? Rise of desktop push notifications. Increase functionality in push notifications. Investigate current limitations / possibilities. Personalization / generic / etc etc

- Can we construct a measurable metric to determine the sweet spot for users to keep notifications on?

2. Methods for troubleshooting multi-step workflows in micro-services architecetures

- Imagine several different apis having to be called async from a clinet. Response from each API req -> payload for next req (pipeline). Investigate methods for handling failing requests (400/500) to provide a better user experience and increasing visibility while troubleshooting. E.g. you have 3 internal APIs, but two that are third party requests (Amazon/twilio) that can't pass through a workflow correlation ID.

- Explore different solutions for providing a troubleshooting technique for multi-step workflows in microservices architecetures.

3. Increase in-app / in-site logins (gdpr, more information)

- How to increase engagement via in-app logins to allow for more personalization and data-collection to drive sales and ad views
